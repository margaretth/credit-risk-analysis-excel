# 📊 Credit Risk Analysis with Excel  
## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes loan data to understand **credit risk patterns**. Using Excel, I cleaned, transformed, and visualized the dataset to identify factors linked to **loan repayment vs. default**.  

---

## 🎯 Business Problem  
Financial institutions struggle to spot **high-risk borrowers**. High defaults reduce profits, while rejecting too many loans limits revenue.  

**Objective:** Find insights to help lenders minimize defaults and improve loan approval strategies.  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning  
- Removed duplicates & high-missing-value columns  
- Handled outliers  
- Converted `loan_status` into binary labels (0 = Safe, 1 = Risky)  
- Selected relevant features for analysis  

---

## 📊 Key Insights  
- The **largest loan amount** is **$10,000 USD**.  
- **60-month loans** show **higher default risk** than 36-month loans.  
- Loans with **“Verified” income status** are more likely to be repaid.  
- **Low-grade borrowers** dominate and default more often than high-grade ones.  
- **Debt consolidation** is the top purpose for both safe and risky borrowers.  
- **Grade 4** had the most successful repayments, while **Grade 3** had the most defaults.  
- **Top 5 loan purposes**: Credit card, MSME business, debt consolidation, home improvement, home purchase.

## ✅ Conclusion  
Credit risk depends on multiple factors. Lenders should be cautious with **long-term, high-interest, and low-grade loans**, and apply **data-driven scoring models** to reduce defaults and improve portfolio performance.
